# _My crush_ (Nope), RoChe's class final Project of FIT 2, for Semester Spring 2023 (May 31, 2023)

### Brief Intro.:
1. It is a Gomoku, or Five-in-a-Row game based on [Pyxel, a retro-2D game Engine](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel).
2. In this game, the human player, a.k.a. player 1, plays against a bot program, or Player 2.
3. Game UI Resolution (Vertically * Horizontally): 520 * 480 pixels
4. Instructions: Use mouse cursor and 'SPACE' key to place the chess piece; 'Q' key to quit the program at any time; 'R' key to skip the waiting time between each round.
5. Only sound in this game is played after a player won the round.
6. For Children between the age of 5 and 9 on Eastern US, bot's winning rate is around 40 %.

### Current Issues About the Bot:
1. For some time, it does not try to place chess to win.
2. When human player places chess pieces in 2 or more rows, it only reacts to one row.
3. It does not sort out priorities between stopping player 1 or winning the round.
